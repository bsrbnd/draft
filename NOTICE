SymProc annotation-processor
Copyright 2015-2016 Bernard Blaser

SymProc is an annotation-processor prototype intended to
experiment with new Java language features and shouldn't
be used for any other purpose.
SymProc has been influenced by the Lisp language.

SymProc relies on OpenJDK 1.8 (langtools) undocumented API.

Some examples of use concern genetic programming.
