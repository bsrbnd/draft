SymProc annotation-processor
Copyright 2015-2016 Bernard Blaser

SymProc is an annotation-processor prototype intended to
experiment with new Java language features and shouldn't
be used for any other purpose.

SymProc has been influenced by the foundations of the
LISP language. For original publications, see:
http://www-formal.stanford.edu/jmc/

SymProc relies on OpenJDK 1.8 (langtools) undocumented API.
Source code and useful information can be found at:

Some examples of use concern genetic programming.
